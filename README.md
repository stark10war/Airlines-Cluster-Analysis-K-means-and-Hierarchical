# K-Means-Clustering---Airlines-Cluster
The Objective of the clustering is to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline's frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.

#################################################################################################
>> The file AirlinesCluster.csv contains information on 3,999 members of the frequent flyer program.
There are seven different variables in the dataset, described below:
•	Balance = number of miles eligible for award travel
•	QualMiles = number of miles qualifying for TopFlight status
•	BonusMiles = number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
•	BonusTrans = number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
•	FlightMiles = number of flight miles in the past 12 months
•	FlightTrans = number of flight transactions in the past 12 months
•	DaysSinceEnroll = number of days since enrolled in the frequent flyer program
