# K-Means-Clustering---Airlines-Cluster
The Objective of the clustering is to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline's frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.

I did the clustering with using both K-means CLustering and Hierarchical Clustering.

#################################################################################################
>> The file AirlinesCluster.csv contains information on 3,999 members of the frequent flyer program.
There are seven different variables in the dataset, described below:
•	Balance = number of miles eligible for award travel
•	QualMiles = number of miles qualifying for TopFlight status
•	BonusMiles = number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
•	BonusTrans = number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months
•	FlightMiles = number of flight miles in the past 12 months
•	FlightTrans = number of flight transactions in the past 12 months
•	DaysSinceEnroll = number of days since enrolled in the frequent flyer program

>> The .R file contains the code for both K means and Hierarchical clustering.
>> The Hierarchical Cluster Output folder contains 3 files
  1. The Dendrogram image file.
  2. the hierarchical cluster result in a csv file which is same as data file with added cluster column.
  3. The Hierarchical cluster mean summary csv file includes the cluster means for different variables.

>> The K-means Cluster Output folder contains 2 files
  1. the K-means cluster result csv file which is same as data file with added cluster column.
  3. The K-means cluster mean summary csv file includes the cluster means for different variables.
>> Clone the repo. and change the path for csv file.

Thanks.
